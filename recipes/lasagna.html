    <h1>HOMEMADE LASAGNA</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpeg" alt="lasagna">
    <p>Lasagna is a beloved Italian pasta dish that's as delicious as it is comforting.
        It consists of layers of wide, flat pasta noodles, typically lasagna sheets,
        alternated with rich and savory ingredients. The key components are usually
        sheets of pasta, a hearty meat or vegetarian sauce (such as Bolognese or
        marinara), creamy b√©chamel sauce, and a generous helping of cheese, often 
        mozzarella and Parmesan. These layers are assembled in a baking dish and 
        then baked to perfection, resulting in a mouthwatering, cheesy, and satisfying
        casserole-like creation. Lasagna is known for its warm, hearty flavors and is
        a classic comfort food enjoyed by people around the world.</p>
